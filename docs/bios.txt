<p align='justify'> Chris Baldassano studies how the human brain perceives and remembers complex real-world experiences.  He uses fMRI and computational models to gain insights into the brain network dynamics underlying these processes.</p>

<p align='justify'> Luke Chang studies the neurobiological and psychological processes underlying social interactions.  He is particularly interested in  how emotions and expectations are represented in the brain and impact how we make decisions and learn in social contexts.  He uses neuroimaging and computational models to elucidate these processes.</p>

<p align='justify'> Janice Chen studies how we construct and retrieve memories of complex real-world episodes.  She uses realistic stimuli (e.g. movies and narratives) and behaviors (e.g. spoken recall) that contain rich natural semantics and unfold continusouly across multiple timescales.  She uses between-brain temporal and pattern analysis methods to ask how mnemonic and sensory systems operate together dynamically to create the present moment.</p>

<p>Nicholas Christakis studies the relationship between social networks and well-being. His research engages two types of phenomena: the social, mathematical, and biological rules governing how social networks form (“connection”), and the biological and social implications of how they operate to influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (“contagion”). Ongoing investigations in his lab explore the genetic bases for human social behaviors and the application of social network principles to change population-level behavior related to health, cooperation, and economic development.</p>

<p>Sam Gershman studies how richly structured knowledge about the environment is acquired, and how this knowledge aids adaptive behavior. He uses a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to pursue these questions. One prong of his research focuses on how humans and animals discover the hidden states underlying their observations, and how they represent these states. A second prong of his research is focused on teasing apart the interactions between different learning systems (e.g. goal-directed vs. habitual).</p>

<p>Caterina Gratton studies the physiological mechanisms underlying intrinsic networks, the roles of individual regions within these networks, and how network organization is maintained and dynamically altered in different goal-directed contexts such as attention and cognitive control. She uses a variety of methods including neuroimaging, TMS, recordings from patients with focal brain lesions, and pharmacological manipulations to study perturbations of brain systems.</p>

<p>Yarik Halchenko is a major developer for several popular neuroscientific software projects including NeuroDebian, PyMVPA, and DataLad.  His research goal is to make neuroscience a better science: open, efficient, and reproducible.</p>

<p>Jim Haxby's research focuses on the development of computational methods for building models of representational spaces. His lab uses fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to measure the brain patterns that represent different cognitive states.  He uses complex, natural stimuli to sample a broad range of brain representational states as a basis for building high-dimensional models of representational spaces within cortical fields.</p>

<p>Chris Honey's research is centered around two fundamental questions about how our brains process incoming information.  First, how do we combine fast and slow information processing to perceive the world?  Second, which regions organize the flow of information through the brain, and how?  He uses a variety of neuroimaging and computational modeling techniques to study these processes.</p>

<p>Jeremy Manning studies how the ever-changing thoughts we carry into each new moment affect how we process incoming information and remember it later.  He is particularly interested in developing tools for tracking these dynamic patterns of thought, including how these patterns are supported by dynamic interactions between our brain structures.  He uses a variety of neuroimaging and computational modeling techniques to study these phenomena.</p>

<p>Ida Mommenejad studies how humans use memory to plan and control their future. Her research is motivated by the idea that memory is not merely a repository for past experience, but also a tool for planning and bringing about future experience. She is interested in the intersection of two kinds of cognitive control: the control of memory and the control of action. She uses behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to study how humans store, modify, and use memory in prospection, planning, and decision-making.</p>

<p>Matt van der Meer studies the interplay between learning, memory, and prediction in rodents performing decision tasks. He records and decodes the activities of many neurons simultaneously during behavior to reveal the neural representations and transformations that underlie cognitive processes such as deliberation, inference, and planning. Through a combination of neurobiological and computational approaches, he seeks a fundamental understanding of these processes at the level of neural circuits, within and across interacting brain areas such as the hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex.</p>

<p>Thalia Wheatley studies the uniquely human ability to re-purpose evolutionarily ancient mental abilities in new ways. This flexibility allows us to create ever-changing genres of art, invent and learn new technologies, and manage our unusually vast and fluid social networks. However, because we are using old tools, our modern world is not without interesting quirks. So far, her lab has shown how these quirks explain why dolls are creepy, why music moves us, and the particular ways we think about friendship.</p>
