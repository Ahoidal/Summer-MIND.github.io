<p>Day 1 is dedicated to setting up the computing stack and discussing data sharing and effective strategies for code development.  We'll divide into two groups according to prior experience.  Track 1 will cover GitHub, Python, and Jupyter, and Track 2 will cover advanced topics.  Lab: D3, graphviz.</p>

<p>The focus of day 2 is on project pitches.  Through informal discussions  short project pitches, and hackathon-style group activities, we will brainstorm project ideas to focus on for the duration of the program.  (These may shift and evolve over the rest of the week.)</p>

<p>We'll discuss general strategies for building effective, testable models.  Then we'll put the ideas into practice in an afternoon hackathon session.</p>

<p>We'll have an introduction to working with network data.  Lab: network data hackathon.</p>

<p>We'll cover more advanced topics in brain interactions, including techniques and models for discovering connectivity patterns in different types of datasets.  Lab: connectivity hackathon.</p>

<p>We'll extend our toolkit to account for <i>changing</i> connectivity patterns.  Lab: tools for analyzing network dynamics.</p>

<p>How do dynamic brain patterns reflect our thoughts?  How can we uncover meaning from brain circuit dynamics?  What functions to social group dynamics suggest?  We'll discuss how to translate dynamic network patterns into meaningful neuroscientific, psychological, and social processes.  Lab: decoding hackathon.</p>

<p>Attendees will present their projects and we'll have a closing reception to celebrate the awesome sciencing we did.</p>
