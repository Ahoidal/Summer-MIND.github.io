<h3>Why Dartmouth?</h3>
<p>The three levels of analysis central to the course are
directly reflected in the expertise of the organizers:
hippocampal circuits that support learning and memory
(<a href=http://www.vandermeerlab.org/>van der Meer</a>),
full-brain network interactions that support high-level
cognition (<a href=http://www.context-lab.com/>Manning</a>),
and interpersonal and group dynamics that support social
interactions (<a href=http://cosanlab.com>Chang</a>), all
recent hires in the department of Department for Psychological
and Brain Sciences. This department has a rich history in
pioneering innovations in Cognitive Neuroscience: in 1988,
Michael Gazzaniga and colleagues began the Summer Institute in
Cognitive Neuroscience, which moved to UCSB in 2007. In 1999,
Dartmouth was the first academic psychology program to operate
its own research-dedicated MRI scanner, which was a key aspect
to training at the Summer Institute. The department has
organized regular summer workshops in
<a href=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~ccn/workshops/index.html>computational
cognitive neuroscience</a>. Beyond the department, Dartmouth
has a strong active interdisciplinary community interested in
computational science coordinated by the
<a href=http://neukom.dartmouth.edu/>Neukom Institute for
Computational science</a>, which sponsors many speaker series
and workshops, including a
<a href=http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/dinr/>network
science workgroup</a>. Finally, Dartmouthâ€™s picturesque,
compact campus in rural New England contributes to a shared
group experience for the participants that promotes
collaboration and lasting relationships.</p>
