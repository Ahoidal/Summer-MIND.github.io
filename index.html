								<h2>Vision</h2>
                                <p>There is a growing gap between how we train graduate students in psychology and neuroscience and what they actually need to know to do cutting edge work.  We see two <b>fundamental</b> issues driving this gap, which we hope to address with our proposed summer school program.  First, most training programs do not expose students to the latest computational tools.  Second, an even greater challenge is to supplement the traditional reductionist approach to studying the elements of brain, cognition, and behavior in isolation, to integrating how these elements interact as a cohesive complex system.  This entails considering not just which elements in a network interact, but also the content of the interaction, and the dynamics of how this information flows through the network over time.  This general issue is present in multiple domains, with an accompanying need for similar tools: neurophysiologists studying spiking activity in ensembles of single neurons, cognitive neuroscientists studying whole-brain activity levels, and social psychologists studying group interactions. This commonality creates an opportunity for scientific innovation and training, and drives the <b>key distinguishing feature</b> of our proposed summer school: to provide integrated training of network methods at the <b>circuit, whole-brain, and social network levels</b>.</p>

                            <h2>Major objectives</h2>
								<p>We have three main objectives. First, participants will be introduced to research problems at the three scales: circuits, brains, and social networks. These will set the stage for our second objective: hands-on training using specific computational methods. Third, the cross-topic nature of the summer school creates an opportunity for the emergence and incubation of novel research directions.  Exposing participants to theoretical frameworks and research questions that span these traditional boundaries will help spawn new research ideas. Ultimately, we hope to provide the necessary tools to pursue these ideas around the unifying theme of complex network dynamics and their implications for function at different scales.</p>

								<h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>To accomplish our objectives, the summer program will span 8 days, with each day structured into three sessions. <b>Morning lecture sessions</b> will begin with a brief introduction to the day’s topic, followed by an invited speaker that highlights the use of specific methods within the context of a particular research question.  After lunch there will be a <b>hands-on laboratory</b>, where participants will use the core methods presented in the morning lecture using prepared tutorials and exercises. Finally, late afternoon/evenings will provide time for participants to work together with the course instructors to <b>develop new projects</b> inspired by discussions from earlier in the day in a “hackathon” format. Suggested projects are provided, but will ideally be self-generated by participants and inspired by discussions that arise during the course to test new ideas or develop new methods. Participants will present their projects on the last day of the course.  We will also have 1-hour <b>breakout sessions</b> each afternoon that will cover smaller focused topics for interested participants.  This will include short talks by interested students on relevant research findings or methods.</p>
