								<h2>Vision</h2>
                                <p>There is a growing gap between how we train graduate students in psychology and neuroscience and what they actually need to know to do cutting edge work.  We see two <b>fundamental</b> issues driving this gap, which we hope to address with our proposed summer school program.  First, most training programs do not expose students to the latest computational tools.  Second, an even greater challenge is to supplement the traditional reductionist approach to studying the elements of brain, cognition, and behavior in isolation, to integrating how these elements interact as a cohesive complex system.  This entails considering not just which elements in a network interact, but also the content of the interaction, and the dynamics of how this information flows through the network over time.  This general issue is present in multiple domains, with an accompanying need for similar tools: neurophysiologists studying spiking activity in ensembles of single neurons, cognitive neuroscientists studying whole-brain activity levels, and social psychologists studying group interactions. This commonality creates an opportunity for scientific innovation and training, and drives the <b>key distinguishing feature</b> of our proposed summer school: to provide integrated training of network methods at the <b>circuit, whole-brain, and social network levels</b>.</p>

                            <h2>Major objectives</h2>
								<p>We have three main objectives. First, participants will be introduced to research problems at the three scales: circuits, brains, and social networks. These will set the stage for our second objective: hands-on training using specific computational methods. Third, the cross-topic nature of the summer school creates an opportunity for the emergence and incubation of novel research directions.  Exposing participants to theoretical frameworks and research questions that span these traditional boundaries will help spawn new research ideas. Ultimately, we hope to provide the necessary tools to pursue these ideas around the unifying theme of complex network dynamics and their implications for function at different scales.</p>

								<h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>To accomplish our objectives, the summer program will span 8 days, with each day structured into three sessions. <b>Morning lecture sessions</b> will begin with a brief introduction to the day’s topic, followed by an invited speaker that highlights the use of specific methods within the context of a particular research question.  After lunch there will be a <b>hands-on laboratory</b>, where participants will use the core methods presented in the morning lecture using prepared tutorials and exercises. Finally, late afternoon/evenings will provide time for participants to work together with the course instructors to <b>develop new projects</b> inspired by discussions from earlier in the day in a “hackathon” format. Suggested projects are provided, but will ideally be self-generated by participants and inspired by discussions that arise during the course to test new ideas or develop new methods. Participants will present their projects on the last day of the course.  We will also have 1-hour <b>breakout sessions</b> each afternoon that will cover smaller focused topics for interested participants.  This will include short talks by interested students on relevant research findings or methods.</p>

                            <h2>Matthijs van der Meer</h2>
								<p>The van der Meer lab studies the interplay between learning, memory, and prediction in rodents performing decision tasks. We record and decode the activity of many neurons simultaneously during behavior to reveal the neural representations and transformations that underlie cognitive processes such as deliberation, inference, and planning. Through a combination of neurobiological and computational approaches, we seek a fundamental understanding of these processes at the level of neural circuits, within and across interacting brain areas such as the hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex. We believe that in the long term, this understanding can support sustained innovation in the prevention and treatment of disorders such as addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

								<h2>Luke J. Chang</h2>
                            <p>My research focuses on understanding the neurobiological and psychological processes underlying social interactions.  I am interested in understanding how emotions and expectations are represented in the brain and impact how we make decisions and learn in social contexts. We use computational techniques such as utility theory, reinforcement-learning, and machine-learning to develop models of these complex processes and validate our models using behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments.  One application of this approach is to create a better understanding of the mechanisms by which psychosocial treatments influence our mental and physical health.</p>

								<p>My current research focuses on the development of computational methods for building models of representational spaces. We assume that distributed population responses encode information. Within a cortical field, a broad range of stimuli or cognitive states can be represented as different patterns of response. We use fMRI to measure these patterns of response and multivariate pattern (MVP) analysis to decode their meaning. We are currently developing methods that make it possible to decode an individual’s brain data using MVP classifiers that are based on other subjects’ data. We use a complex, natural stimulus to sample a broad range of brain representational states as a basis for building high-dimensional models of representational spaces within cortical fields. These models are based on response tuning functions that are common across subjects. Initially, we demonstrated the validity of such a model in ventral temporal cortex. We are working on building similar models in other visual areas and in auditory areas. We also plan to investigate representation of social cognition using this same conceptual framework.</p>

I use a variety of methods to address these questions, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to track the spatial and dynamic characteristics of brain activity, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), recordings from patients with focal brain lesions, and pharmacological manipulations to study perturbations of brain systems.</p>

								<p>I study how the human brain is able to perceive and remember our complex real-world experiences. How can we so quickly understand high-level properties of our environment, such as where we are and which actions we can take next? How do we break up our lives into events that we can understand and later recall as stories? Functional MRI, along with new analysis tools, have started to give us insight into the structure of the brain networks underlying these processes. </p>

                            <h2>Christoher Honey</h2>
								<p>To understand the world around us, we must combine patterns of information that arrive over multiple time-scales. For example, while having a conversation we continuously perceive not only each spoken word, but also the emerging meaning of that word within a larger sentence, and the meaning of each sentence in the context of the conversation. Data from fMRI and ECoG studies suggest that brain regions are organized in a hierarchy according to the time-scale on which they process information. Regions at the lower levels of the hierarchy sustain representations of sensory information (e.g. word acoustics) over short periods of time, while higher-order regions maintain more abstract representations over seconds and minutes. Thus, our unfolding experience of the world arises from activity within a hierarchical network of functionally specific regions.</p>
                                <p>A typical brain region maintains reciprocal connections with more than a dozen others. Therefore, information can potentially flow in all directions within the brain: downward from the top of the functional hierarchy, upward from the bottom, and also laterally. However, some brain regions are especially effective in organizing and switching the flow of information, as occurs for instance when we switch our attention from what somebody is saying to their facial expression. Our neuroimaging and computational modeling studies suggest that these “hub” regions are found near the top of the functional hierarchy and that they maintain anatomical links across many different areas. The mechanisms are uncertain, but system-specific brain rhythms may be involved in regulating the flow of information. Because brain rhythms can suppress the firing of neurons within a region and also align the firing of neurons in different regions, we study the spatial distribution of brain rhythms and how they change across cognitive states</p>

								<p>How do we construct and retrieve memories of complex real-world episodes? In this research we use realistic stimuli (such as movies and narratives) and behaviors (such as spoken recall) that contain rich natural semantics and unfold continuously across multiple timescales. Employing between-brain temporal and pattern analysis methods, we ask how mnemonic and sensory systems operate together dynamically to create the present moment.</p>

								<p>I study how humans use memory to plan and control their future. My research is motivated by the idea that memory is not merely a repository for past experience, but also a tool for planning and bringing about future experience. As we navigate the world, we build and store representations of the structures we experience that can be easily retrieved later on. We use these representations to simulate/imagine and plan future actions when we make decisions and take actions in the face of uncertainty. I'm interested in the intersection of two kinds of cognitive control: the control of memory and the control of action. How do humans build and update representations of the structures that underlie our experience and the effect of our actions? Once a plan is in place, how do humans manage working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) representations to perform ongoing tasks and realize plans? I use behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to study how humans store, modify, and use memory in prospection, planning, and decision-making.</p>
